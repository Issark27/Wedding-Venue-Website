Created a website that used PHP to gain access of a MySQL database which contained information about different wedding venues and used this information to display to users of the site. The website was created in a
way such that users were able to put in specific criteria on the website such as the date of the wedding, their budget, the capacity, etc and the information of available wedding venues was then displayed in a way
that made it easy and more appealing for users to choose their preferred venue. Additionally, a database containing information on reviews of each venue was then used to convey to the user what the average rating
was as well as display it in the form of a graph which I was able to do using chart.js. I added lots of little details to make the user experience as easy as possible while also implementing lots of
functionality.
